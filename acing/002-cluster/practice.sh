[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.25.3
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.25.3
I0103 01:30:26.841316    1743 version.go:256] remote version is much newer: v1.26.0; falling back to: stable-1.25
[upgrade/versions] Target version: v1.25.5
[upgrade/versions] Latest version in the v1.25 series: v1.25.5

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT       TARGET
kubelet     1 x v1.25.3   v1.25.5

Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.25 series:

COMPONENT                 CURRENT   TARGET
kube-apiserver            v1.25.3   v1.25.5
kube-controller-manager   v1.25.3   v1.25.5
kube-scheduler            v1.25.3   v1.25.5
kube-proxy                v1.25.3   v1.25.5

etcd                      3.5.4-0   3.5.4-0

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

        kubeadm upgrade apply v1.25.5

Note: Before you can perform this upgrade, you have to update kubeadm to v1.25.5.

The table below shows the current state of component configs as understood by this version of kubeadm.
Configs that have a "yes" mark in the "MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED" column require manual config upgrade or
resetting to kubeadm defaults before a successful upgrade can be performed. The version to manually
upgrade to is denoted in the "PREFERRED VERSION" column.

API GROUP                 CURRENT VERSION   PREFERRED VERSION   MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED
kubeproxy.config.k8s.io   v1alpha1          v1alpha1            no
kubelet.config.k8s.io     v1beta1           v1beta1             no
