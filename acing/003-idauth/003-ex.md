<p>Create a new role named “sa-creator” that will <br />allow creating service accounts.</p>
|`kubectl create role sa-creator --verb=create,get,list resource=pods`|

|Create a role binding that is associated with the previous “sa-creator” role, named
“sa-creator-binding” that will bind to the user “Sandra”.|   |
|Use the “auth can-i” command to verify that you can create service accounts as the
user Sandra.|   |
|Create a new user named “Sandra”, first creating the private key, then the certificate
signing request, then using the CSR resource in Kubernetes to generate the client
certificate.|   |
|Add that new user “Sandra” to your local kubeconfig using the kubectl config
command.|   |
|Create a new service account named ’secure-sa’ and create a pod that uses the
‘secure-sa’ service account. Make sure the token is not exposed to the pod.|   |
|Create a new cluster role named ‘acme-corp-role’ that will allow the create action on deployments, replicates, and daemonsets. Bind that cluster role to the service account ’secure-sa’ and make sure the service account can only create the assigned resources within the default namespace and nowhere else. Use auth can-i to verify that the ‘secure-sa’ service account cannot create deployments in the kube-system namespace and output the result of the command + the command itself to a file and share that
file.|   |
